# Price-Tracker-Bot
This Bot automatically scraps your desired item on any website( I have used Amazon as an example) and sends you an alert when prices have dropped.
INSTALL: Beautiful Soup Library as well as SMPT library. 
Did this to get cheapest items for Christmas shopping during Amazon Black Friday Sales. More bang for your bucks.

For best result, run it as a batch file or use window scheduler to automatically compile script every few hours.
